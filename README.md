# Technical assignment front-end engineer

Minimal Kanban board.

Task:

- be able to create tickets on the board.
- be able to move tickets between the various columns in an interactive way, persisting across page refreshes.
- be able to share a direct link to the ticket.

**Minimal requirements**

The three pillars of front-end development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like to see you know how to use them for the right job.

- Use React
- Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care.
- Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using your favourite styling solution.
- Interact with an API. [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) can be used to add a fake REST API or you can decide to build your own.
